# subglacial-brine-flow
We adapted a subglacial hydrology model to account for saline fluid below the pressure melting point. 

The main model is called subglacial_brine_flow.m and is run by run_subglacial_brine_flow.m. 

Variations of the model are in the following m-files. 
  1. water_varying_density_subglacial_flow.m run by run water_varying_density_subglacial_flow.m.
  2. temp_subglacial_brine_flow.m run by run_temp_subglacial_brine_flow.m
